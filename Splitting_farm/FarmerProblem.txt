This was a problem that was posed to me recently. A farmer has a plot of land that he needs to tend and 3 daughters to tend it.
He needs to split up his farm into three equal pieces and divide up the land so their are barriers between the 3 pieces.
He's cheap so he wants to use as little fencing as possible. Find the orientation of the fence such that it divides the farm evenly into 3 parts but minimizes the length of fence needed.
