    "Functional programming\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "+ In an imperative programming style we are concerned with *how* the program achieves the end result. \n",
    "+ Functional programming helps us to focus more on *what* the end result is. \n",
    "+ An imperative program will describe how the **state** of the program is updated by the commands, or _statements_, and the order to execute them; \n",
    "    + in functional style the order is not important.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Functional programming essentialy breaks the code down into smaller functions, or _expressions_, that take only input and produce an output that is not dependent on the state of the system.\n",
    "    + _The function will always produce the same output for a given input._\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Whereas an imperative program will be a series of expressions for the computer to execute, a pure functional program will be a series of definitions of the functions and a single expression that returns the result of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Intput -> Function 1 -> Function 2 -> Function 3 -> Output\n",
    "\n",
    "This part was inspired from several sources. For further, in-depth reading, you can find them here:\n",

    "* [http://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html](http://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html)\n",

    "\n",
    "The functional approach varies by user and this lesson will be a bit of an amalgamation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a scientist, functional programming offers benefits in terms of clearly defining the mathematical parts of your problems, but can also place severe limitations on the ability to process data and deal with inherently stateful problems. With Python we can get the best of both worlds by applying functional paradigms where they are appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some benefits of a functional style are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Modularity\n",
    "    + Forces consideration of how to break up code into smaller blocks\n",
    "    + Helps to enforce DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n",
    "+ Debugging and testing\n",
    "    + Each function can be tested individually\n",
    "    + Errors are easily traceable to the function level as everything else is invariant\n",
    "+ Formal provability\n",
    "    + Some of the restrictive aspects that we will encounter enable mathematical proof of the correctness of programs.\n",
